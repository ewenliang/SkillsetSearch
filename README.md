# SkillsetSearch
This is the start of a project I'm calling Skillset Search. In an effort to learn more about Data Analysis and Data Science, I am on a journey to grow my technical skills. However, this is easier said than done! The Analytics field is incredibly nebulous with many companies of different kinds asking for (and prioritizing!) different technical skills. My goal is to use this project, to both learn about what the top companies are looking for, and to help push myself to learn and understand the correct tools for the world of data.

## Project Plan
My tentative project plan is looking like this:

1. Scrape the web for business analyst, data analyst, business intelligence developer, and data science roles (and more depending on what's out there)
2. Clean the data for analysis
3. Organize the data by Role, Experience Level, Industry, and more in order to conduct analysis
4. Based off of the most relevant/desired skills found, develop a curriculum centered around my analysis
5. Learn the tools through online courses, projects, and more
6. Track my learning process by collecting data and tracking relevant KPIs
7. Get a job?

As I move along in this project, I will use GitHub to track my progress through regular writeups, code chunks, and ultimately the finished product. I plan to commit a chunk of time outside of my full-time job to this project in order to sooner or later find employment in the world of data.
